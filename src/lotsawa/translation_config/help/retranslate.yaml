  This is a tool to use NLLB to re-translate an English translation into another language, such as Italian or Chinese. You should first use the translate CLI and edit the resulting English translation as appropriate before using this tool.

  Main configuration options:

  input_glob: A glob of English input files to translate. Defaults to "translations/*.en".

  model:
  
    This configuration group configures the model to be used for re-translation.

    hf_model_name: The Hugging Face name of the model to use. Defaults to "facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M". Should be compatible with the M2M architecture.

    cuda: Use an NVIDIA GPU. Requires CUDA >= 11.x. Defaults to false.

    max_length: Maximum length, in tokens, of a generated target language sentence. Defaults to 200.
  

  output:

    target_language_code: The NLLB language code for the target language to re-translate into.

    list_language_codes: Instead of re-translating, only list the language codes supported by the model.

    output_extension: File extension of the re-translated output. Defaults to the value of target_language_code.

    output_dir: Output directory, defaults to "./translations".

  generation:

    Allows fine-grained control over the text generation algorithm. We recommend not changing this unless you really need to.

    generation.num_beams: Number of beams in the beam search. Default is 10.

    generation.generator_kwargs: All Hugging Face generator function keyword arguments can go here, see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.23.1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate.

    Most important that you may wish to tweak is repetition_penalty. Others of interest are no_repeat_ngram_size, length_penalty, exponential_decay_length_penalty, max_time.

    word_exclusion_list: A path to a YAML file that contains target language keys with lists of words to exclude from generation. For example:
  
      zho_Hans:
        - Sariputra
        - 萨里普特拉

      rus_Cyrl:
        - sariputra
        - avalokitesvara
        - замалчивания

    alphabet: A Unicode alphabet name to enforce alphabet constraints. The model will only generate tokens that consist of characters that either belong to a set of common characters such as commas and spaces, or characters whose unicode names contain the name of the alphabet specified here (with the exception of chinese - the alphabet name is mapped to CJK unified). The complete list of alphabets, in alphabetical order, is:

      arabic, armenian, bengali, chinese, cyrillic, devangari, ethiopic, georgian, greek, gujarati, gurmukhi, hangul, hebrew, hiragana, kannada, katakana, khmer, lao, latin, malayalam, myanmar, ol chiki, oriya, sinhala, tamil, telugu, thai, tibetan, tifinagh
