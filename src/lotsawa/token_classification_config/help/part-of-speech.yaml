  This CLI segments Tibetan input into words and tags the words according to the Universal Dependency parts of speech.

  Note that, due to the current tokenization strategy, word segments may include what a native speaker would consider to be multiple words. In this case the tag will include multiple parts of speech.

  Currently this CLI only works in interactive mode and has no lay-person configuration options.
