  This CLI segments Tibetan input into words and tags the words according to the Universal Dependency parts of speech.

  Note that, due to the current tokenization strategy, word segments may include what a native speaker would consider to be multiple words. In this case the tag will include multiple parts of speech.

  This CLI supports both interactive and batch mode.

  mode: batch, interactive (default)
  
    Batch mode will process a glob of input files.
      mode.input_glob (required): A glob of Tibetan input files to segment and tag.
      mode.output_dir: Output directory, defaults to "./pos_tags"
      mode.output_extension: Extension of output files, defaults to "pos".
      mode.output_pickle_file: Output a pickle file that contains the tagged segments, to make loading for downstream analytics easier.
    
    Interactive mode will process console inputs.
  
  cuda: Use an NVIDIA GPU. Requires CUDA >= 11.x.
